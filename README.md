## ðŸ“ˆ Project 2: Stock Price Prediction

### What Does This Project Do?
This project helps predict whether a stock's price will go up or down in the future. It's like having a crystal ball for the stock market!

### How Does It Work?
1. **Data Collection**:
   - We get stock price data from Apple (AAPL)
   - The data includes daily prices, trading volume, etc.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - We calculate important numbers like:
     - Daily returns (how much the price changed)
     - Moving averages (average price over time)
     - Volatility (how much the price jumps around)

3. **Making Predictions**:
   - We use a special type of computer program called LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
   - It's really good at learning patterns over time
   - It looks at past prices to predict future prices

4. **Results**:
   - We get predictions for future stock prices
   - We can see how accurate our predictions are
   - We create visual graphs to show the predictions
   - We save all results in files for easy viewing

### Files Created:
- `stock_confusion_matrix.png`: Shows how accurate our predictions are
- `stock_training_history.png`: Shows how the model learned
- `stock_predictions.csv`: Contains all the predictions
